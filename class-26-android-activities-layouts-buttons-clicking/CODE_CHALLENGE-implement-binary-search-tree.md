# Implement a Binary Search Tree
Implement a binary search tree with an add() method that enforces smaller
values always go to the `left` node and larger values always go `right`.

Write methods `min()` and `max()` that return the smallest and largest values
in the tree.

Write a method `contains(val)` that returns true only if the Binary Tree
contains the value passed in.
