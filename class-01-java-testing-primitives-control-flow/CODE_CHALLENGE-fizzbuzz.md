# FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
“Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

This has become a classic programming problem that serves as a litmus test to
see if a programmer knows the basics of a language. Companies have been known
to ask job applicants this question during the very first stage of the interview
process just to make sure they're talking to a real programmer!
