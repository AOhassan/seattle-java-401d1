This day is dedicated to creating an app that uses all the functionality of
Firebase. It's a chance to tie everything together into one cohesive app.

It's centered around creating a chat application that depends on:
* The realtime database
* Firebase Auth
* Firebase Storage (for pictures, user profiles)
* Firebase Cloud Messaging (to notify users)
