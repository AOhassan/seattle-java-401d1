# Nth From End of Linked List
Write a function `nthFromEnd` that accepts a link list and an integer `n` and
returns the nth element from the end of the list. You may assume `n` is less
than the number of elements in the list, and `n == 0` should return the very
last element in the list.

```
ll = [23, 45, 34, 65, 94] // size: 5
nthFromEnd(ll, 0)         // returns 94
nthFromEnd(ll, 1)         // returns 65
...
nthFromEnd(ll, 4)         // returns 23
```
