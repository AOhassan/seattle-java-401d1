# Breadth-First Graph Traversal
Write an algorithm that uses a Queue to perform a breadth-first graph traversal
of a graph. Mark the Nodes as `visited` as you process them to make sure you
don't search through the same node twice!

Use a `Set<GraphNode>` to keep track of what nodes have been visited.

Return the minimum value on a node in the graph.
