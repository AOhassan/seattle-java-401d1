# Array List
Use your own custom array list you built in today's "Custom Array List" lab
to solve this problem:

Write a function that accepts an `MyArrayList` of integers as a parameter and
manipulates the given list to remove any duplicate elements appearing exactly
beside each other.

Do not create and return a new list, manipulate the original list.

Given a list with:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 2, 2, 1
```

The list should have only these values at the end:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 1
```
