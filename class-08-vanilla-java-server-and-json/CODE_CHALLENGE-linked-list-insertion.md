# Inserting Linked List
Write a method `insertAtIndex` that accepts an integer `index` and a value
and inserts the value at that index in the linked list.

Consider the following cases:
* What happens when someone tries to insert at the front of the list?
* What happens when someone tries to insert in the middle of the list?
* What happens when someone tries to insert at the end of the list?
