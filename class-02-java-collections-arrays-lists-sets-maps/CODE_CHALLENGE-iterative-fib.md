# Fibonacci
Write a function `fib()` that accepts an integer `n` and returns the Nth
fibonacci number.

* The fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
* The first fibonacci number is 1.
* The second fibonacci number is 1.
* The third fibonacci number is equal to the first plus the second.
* Like the third, every next fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two.

* `fib(1)` should return 1.
* `fib(2)` should return 1.
* `fib(3)` should return 2.
* `fib(4)` should return 3.
* `fib(5)` should return 5.
* `fib(6)` should return 8.
* `fib(50)` should return 12,586,269,025.
