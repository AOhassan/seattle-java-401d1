# Sorting Algorithms: Insertion Sort
Write a method that takes a fixed-length array of ints `int[]` and performs
insertion sort. Sort the array in place so an array passed to your algorithm
is modified, and a new array is not returned.

Create a program that creates small, medium, large, and very large arrays,
fills them with random values and calculates how long the sorting algorithm
takes to run. Compare the execution time to other sorting algorithms.
