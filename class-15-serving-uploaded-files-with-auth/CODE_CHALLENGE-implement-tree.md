# Implement Tree
Build your own Tree (of integers) out of two classes:

* A `TreeNode` class for the nodes
  * with an int `value`
  * with a `TreeNode` reference `left`
  * with a `TreeNode` reference `right`
* A `MyTree` class for the entire tree
  * with one `TreeNode` reference `this.root`
  
For reference, here's one possible Binary Tree:
  
```
    10
   /  \
  4   37
 / \    \
1   5    92
```
