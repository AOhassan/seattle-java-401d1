# Implement a Singly Linked List
Build your own Linked List (of integers) out of two classes:

* A `ListNode` class for the nodes
  * with an int `value`
  * with a `ListNode` reference `next`
* A `MyLinkedList` class for the entire list
  * with one `ListNode` reference `this.root`

Write a method called `findMin` that accepts a `MyLinkedList` and returns the
smallest value in the list.
