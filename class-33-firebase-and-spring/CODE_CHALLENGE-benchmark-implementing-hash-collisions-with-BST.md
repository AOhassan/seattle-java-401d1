# Implement Hash Table Collisions with Binary Search Trees
Make a new Hash Table that uses Binary Search Trees to handle collisions
instead of using Linked Lists.

Do you think the Binary Search Trees will handle Collisions and Lookups
faster or slower than using Linked Lists?

Create a program that executes thousands of read and write operations on the
two implementations of the Hash Map and calculates how long it takes for each
to run. Time the read and write operations separately so you can see if there's
a specific niche advantage of one versus the other.
