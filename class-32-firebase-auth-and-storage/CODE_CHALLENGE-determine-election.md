# Determine Election

Write a function called `tally()` that uses your custom Hash Map to iterate
through a list of Strings and count votes for candidates in an election.
Return the String that occurred the most in the list.

The following input should return `'bush'`.

```java
['bush', 'bush', 'bush', 'shrub', 'shrub', 'bush']
```
