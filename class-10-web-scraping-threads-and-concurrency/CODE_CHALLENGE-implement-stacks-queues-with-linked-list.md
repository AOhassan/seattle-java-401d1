# Implement Stacks and Queues
Use a Linked List to create your own custom-built Stacks and Queues.

Your stack should have these methods:
* push - pushes a new value on to the top of the stack.
* pop - returns the value on the top of the stack.
* size - returns an integer with the number of elements in the stack.
* isEmpty - returns true if there are zero elements in the stack.

Your Queue should have these methods:
* enqueue - adds a value to the back of the queue
* dequeue - removes the value at the front of the queue
* size - returns the number of elements in the queue
* isEmpty - returns true or false depending on if the queue is empty

Once you're built these, try solving this problem:

Write a method called `flip` that "turns a stack upside down" by reversing
the order of all the elements in the stack. You may only use one queue as
an additional data structure.
